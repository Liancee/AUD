Task 5:

Two things are "missing" for the task:

	- as  there have to be added the constants F_OK mentioned
	  in my last submission and EEXIST for it to work under 
	  windows for some ppl. What I don't understand is, that
	  my program runs as it's supposed to in my clion 
	  environment on windows, as well as on my linux
	  distribution, but when executed as .exe on my windows
	  host via terminal it's not working properly. The values
	  saved in the xml file are different if saved cuz some-
	  times it seems that the saveCalendar function just 
	  exits with an error, since the file is created but
	  nothing is written to it even tho I had appointments.
	  But I cant debug those 'errors' since they aren't 
	  happening at all when I use the same executeable in
	  clion.
