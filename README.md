Task 5:

Two things are "missing" for the task:
	- as mentioned in my last submission there have to 
	  be added the constants F_OK and EEXIST for it to
	  work under windows for some ppl
	  
	- for task 3/4 I wrote code to display appointments
	  grouped by their date into the listCalendar() 
	  function. When I now sort the appointments for 
	  something that is not date, they are sorted cor-
	  rectly in the internal Calendar array. But when
	  then displayed through the listCalendar func,
	  they get output by date but listed by the sort 
	  criterium wihtin the same date (is that the in-
	  tended way?)
